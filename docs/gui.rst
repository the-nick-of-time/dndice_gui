Usage of the GUI
================

This minimalistic GUI allows you to evaluate expressions quickly with a nice interface.

For an end user, all you really need to know is:

1. Enter your roll in the box.
2. Press the button or press enter to have your roll be evaluated and show up in the field below the text box.
3. Press the up/down keys to navigate through your roll history.

If you make any syntactical errors in your input, those will be shown in the output field.
